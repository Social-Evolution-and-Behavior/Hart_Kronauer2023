Processing code for calcium imaging data from "Sparse and stereotyped encoding implicates a core glomerulus for ant alarm behavior".

Raw data with .nwb files can be found at https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000467

To re-analyze data, first download the archived data at the above link. Next, run the python script on the downloaded archive to convert .nwb files to .tif files. Finally, install and run the ImageJ macro script. In each case you will need to enter the directory containing the source data into the scripts.
